Version Control for Team Mefford
Welcome aboard

I have added the actual ASP.NET webform project to use for your application.
I have included Tim's DBHandlers folder in this project.  I have also provided
a blank webform to be used for the Reservation screen.  All ongoing work to meet
the milestones should be done in this project.

Milestones may be found by clicking Issues on the right-hand side of the screen.
On the Issues screen select Milestones to see goals and due dates.
